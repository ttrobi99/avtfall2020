  <p>Members of Dauphine’s Revival met at a New Orleans open mic show called Liberation Lounge at now closed Blackstar Cafe and Books in the Algiers section of New Orleans and formed the group in 2011.</p>

  <p>The group was founded and is fronted by Tarriona “Tank” Ball on lead vocals; Ball first gained attention as a slam poet.</p>
  <p>The group is anchored by Joshua Johnson on drums and as musical director, Norman Spence on bass and synth keys, Merell Burkett, Jr. on keyboard, and Albert Allenback on alto saxophone and flute.</p>
  <p>Other active contributors include Jonathan Johnson on bass, Anjelika “Jelly” Joseph on background vocals, Etienne Stoufflet on tenor saxophone, and Danny Abel on guitar.</p>

  <p>Writing in The Washingtonian, Heather Rudow described the group’s work as “lively fusion of funk, soul, hip hop, rock, and spoken word.” Speaking to the Times-Picayune, the musicians in the group mentioned a variety of genres they identify with, including rock, folk, gospel and Anjelika “Jelly” Joseph’s invention “Soulful Disney”.</p>
  <p>In addition to Disney, the group has also mentioned anime as influence on the group’s “childlike” and “magical” sensibility, in Ball’s words.</p>
  <p>In the Financial Times, Joshua David Stein said, “Tank and the Bangas don’t conform to the jazz stereotypes trotted out in the lobbies of convention hotels or milked on Frenchman Street.</p>
  <p>It’s New Orleans but it’s New Orleans now.”</p>
