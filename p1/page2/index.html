  <p>Sometimes I wish my life was like a photograph</p>
  <p>Double tap the good ones and just Photoshop the bad</p>
  <p>Put 'em in my wallet, in my pocket, if I need 'em, then I got 'em</p>
  <p>But life don't work like that</p>
  <p>Sometimes I feel like I'm in Nikes on a track</p>
  <p>Even when my feet are up, my mind is runnin' fast (Fast)</p>
  <p>When I'm home, I get impatient, when I'm gone, I kinda hate it</p>
  <p>'Cause my life works like that</p>
  <p>Sunsets and open water</p>
  <p>Skies full of technicolor</p>
  <p>Beauty right in front of you</p>
  <p>There's so much to discover if you</p>
  <p>Stop,</p>
